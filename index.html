    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>
        Sorting in data structures involves arranging data in a specific order, typically ascending or descending, to facilitate easier searching and retrieval. Several sorting algorithms exist, each with varying time and space complexities, stability, and adaptiveness, making them suitable for different scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
        The efficiency of a sorting algorithm is determined by its time and space complexity. Time complexity refers to the time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution with respect to the size of the input. Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by the algorithm for complete execution, including both auxiliary memory and input.

           Quick Sort
        </h4>
            <p>
                Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

        <h4>
            Bubble Sort
        </h4>
        <p>
            Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the list is sorted.

        <h4>
            Insertion Sort
        </h4>
        <p>
            Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly taking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.

        <h4>
            Selection Sort
        </h4>
        <p>
            Selection sort divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region.
